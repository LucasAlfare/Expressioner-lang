# Expressioner Language

This is my own attempt on creating a huge basic programming language.

As this is done only for study, was decided that the language should work as a tool that must be able to parse statements that contain math expressions and variables to be evaluated.

Also, is important to notice that this is calling "language" mostly because the custom syntax, however, it should be work as basic evaluating tool.

# Syntax
As this is doing simple as possible, was defined a simple syntax to declare variables. Those variables can hold expressions which, by its time, can hold number or even other variable names.

Example:

    @varNameA = 1
    @varNameB = -2
    @varNameC = -0.67 * (varA / varB)
    
    @someResultVariableName = varA + (varB - varC) * 10

As seen above, the syntax uses the character `@` to determine when a variable creation is happening. Also, multiple
lines are allowed without needing semicolons to separate then.

# Progress
The language/tool is not finished. Currently, was done
- an `Tokenizer`, which is capable of to break the input source into `tokens` pieces;
- an `Parser`, which can convert the list of tokens generated by the `Tokenizer` in a handful data structure.

# Notes

- This language/tool is being written using Kotlin.
